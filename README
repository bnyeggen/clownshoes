Some document databases are ENTERPRISE GRADE HIGH PERFORMANCE NOSQL SCALABLE BIG
DATA DATABASES.  That is not clownshoes, which is just mmap over a linkedlist of
byte arrays, with in-memory indexing, and no journaling (I may add
journaling later if I use this for something where I care about the data - until
then, don't crash plz).

This would be faster in C, since we could just type-pun the struct-byte conversion,
but I'm using this as the local backing store for a Go-based webapp.  Cgo is a
possibility.
